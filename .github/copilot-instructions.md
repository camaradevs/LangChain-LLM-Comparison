# Configuration Instructions for GitHub Copilot Agent Mode

1. **External Research:**  
   Before making any technical decision or starting an implementation, perform an internet search of official documentation, community discussions (e.g., Stack Overflow, GitHub Discussions), and reputable blogs to validate feasibility, discover best practices, and ensure alignment with the latest standards.

2. **Context Analysis:**  
   Scan the entire repository and its documentation to fully understand dependencies and architecture before writing or editing any code.

3. **Task Decomposition:**  
   Break down each high-level request into clear, manageable subtasks and verify each before proceeding.

4. **Incremental Commits:**  
   After each subtask or every 30â€“50 lines of changes, stage and commit with a concise, descriptive message.

5. **Testing & Linting:**  
   Run all relevant tests and linters after each commit. Only move forward if all checks pass.

6. **Clarification Queries:**  
   If any requirement is unclear, ask a clarifying question instead of guessing.

7. **Style & Conventions:**  
   Adhere strictly to project style guidelines (indentation, naming, file structure) as defined in `.editorconfig` or repo-specific rules.

8. **Summary & Next Steps:**  
   At the end of the task, provide a brief summary of completed changes, test results, and recommendations for further action.
